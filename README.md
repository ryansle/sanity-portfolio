## Ryan Le's Sanity Portfolio

Welcome to the latest version of my personal portfolio site! This time around, I've reworked some of the kinks from my [previous iteration](https://github.com/ryansle/updated-portfolio) and brought in Sanity.io as my content management system!

As always, I felt that I've learned a fair amount since the last time I rebuilt my entire portfolio, and wanted my digital footprint to be more reflective of my abilities as an engineer. Enjoy!

### [](https://github.com/ryansle/updated-portfolio#motivation)Motivation

-   Redevelop my portfolio (again) now that continue to become more and more experienced
-   Polish my portfolio project and give the site a facelift (by rebuilding from scratch!)
-   Play around with a content management system (Sanity.io)
-   Continuously improve my previous design and site content
-   Just build something else using Chakra UI because it's fun

### [](https://github.com/ryansle/updated-portfolio#technologies-used)Technologies Used

-   React.js as a front-end framework
-   JavaScript as an implementation language
-   Chakra UI for configurable, out-of-the-box React.js components
-   Next.js for server-side rendering, routing, and more
-   Sanity.io for content management
-   Visual Studio Code as in the integrated development environment
